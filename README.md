# Accds Sample
The source data file wasn't csv format.  It is a custom format data file.  It happens all the time in real world.  
I needed to make an json file with the given data file and create a json file with tokenizing.
There are so many Regex use in this file.  I believe regex is the best tool to process custom text data.
This is golang app and has good performance.  There is only one data sample file to build this app.
I will use gorouting if there are many data files.  It will show more performance than single thread one.
Also I put unittest file with source.
